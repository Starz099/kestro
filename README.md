# Kestro

[Live Demo](https://kestro.starzz.dev)

Kestro is the definitive platform for developers who recognize that their current typing velocity is fundamentally mid and their coding aura requires a significant upgrade. This application provides a high fidelity environment for software engineers to lock in and master the syntax of various programming languages through focused repetition and elite editor emulations.

## High Level Overview

The platform is designed for those who refuse to be cooked during live coding sessions or technical interviews. By simulating real world development scenarios, Kestro transforms mundane typing practice into a high stakes performance ritual. Whether you are a Vim enthusiast or a VS Code main, the infrastructure is here to ensure your input speed is actually valid.

## Core Features

### Multilingual Logic

Practice your craft in TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Rust, and C++. The content generation is not random noise; it is structured code that respects the architectural patterns of each language.

### Performance Receipts

We provide granular analytics to confirm if you are actually improving or just pressing buttons. Track your WPM, accuracy, and consistency with data visualizations that prove you are locked in.

### Editor Paradigms

Kestro supports multiple interaction models to match your personal workflow:

- Standard: For those who prefer a clean and focused interface.
- Vim: Full terminal emulation for the modal editing elites.
- VS Code: An experience tailored to modern IDE users who value productivity.

## Technology Stack

The stack is absolutely valid and optimized for performance:
